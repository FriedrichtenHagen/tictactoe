# TicTacToe Game
This is a tictactoe game with two levels of difficulty: easy and impossible. 
The impossible mode was achieved using the recursive minimax algorithm. 
The easy mode is random.

## How it's made: 

### Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

I started with letting the computer make random moves. This is far too easy to beat for most humans, so i researched the optimal way of playing the game. 
Using the minimax algorithm it is possible for the computer to recursively evaluate all future moves. 



## Lessons learned: 
This project was a great exercise in javascript. I was able to use my existing knowledge about DOM manipulation. 
A module was used to keep all internal functions private.
Objects for the board and the players are used to store information. 
Furthermore, I used the recursive minimax algorithm, which was a fun challenge.
