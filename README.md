# TicTacToe Game
This is a tictactoe game with to levels of difficulty: easy and impossible. 
The impossible mode was achieved using the recursive minimax algorithm. 
The easy mode is random.

## How it's made: 

### Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

I started with letting the computer make random moves. This is far too easy to beat for most humans, so i researched the optimal way of playing the game. 
Using the minimax algorithm it is possible for the computer to recursively evaluate all future moves.
